# TweakHelpers
A few header files I made that will hopefully help with streamlining tweak and hack development.  For iOSCheaters.com

# Current Files
- Prefshelper.h To help with loading and reading "keys" in the settings files(might not actually be useful)
- Alerthelper.h To help with showing an alert wherever it's wanted/needed.

# TODO List
- IngameUI.h For mod menus or something like that
- You decide :D
